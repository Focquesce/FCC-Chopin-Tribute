    <u>What Makes Chopin so Great?</u>
    <li>Chopin ranks as one of music's greatest tone poets by reason of his superfine imagination and fastidious craftsmanship.</li>
    <li>Chopin was one of the first to write music for the piano in terms of the piano. Beethoven often tried to be orchestral in his piano writing, Schubert to be vocal, whereas Chopin was always completely and convincingly pianistic. </li>
    <li>Chopin invented a new instrumental genre, the ballade.</li>
